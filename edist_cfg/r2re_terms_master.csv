It is primarily designed to accurately follow the three-dimensional motion of water parcels within the mixed layer, through a combination of neutral buoyancy and high drag provided by a one meter diameter black drogue. Typical buoyancies of a few grams result in vertical velocities relative to the water of a few mm/s, small compared to the cm/s turbulent velocities in the mixed layer. The float&rsquo;s motion within the mixed layer thus closely imitates that of a planktonic organism.  The float can also profile vertically.

The Global Hybrid Profiler Mooring (GHPM) consists of a Surface Piercing Profiler (SPP or SeaCycler) to perform profiling measurements in the upper 150m of the water column and a Wire Following Profiler (WFP or McLane Moored Profiler) which takes profiling measurements 3 times per day between 300m to 2300m. Communication between the SPP and the lower part of the mooring (including the WFP) takes place inductively via the SIO controller in 2285m depth which collects all data and passes them to the SPP. The data from all these instruments get transmitted to shore through the satellite communication link of the Surface Piercing Profiler. The AST2 GHPM is a prototype of the Global GHPM moorings that will be deployed at the four Global OOI sites.  http://mooring.ucsd.edu/index.html?/projects/ooi/ooi_data.html,1/23/2014,DeviceTerm,,tbd,
