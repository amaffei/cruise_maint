R2RE/9069,Sediment Trap,Sediment traps are specially designed containers deployed in the water column for periods of time to collect particles from the water column falling toward the sea floor. In general a sediment trap has a jar at the bottom to collect the sample and a broad funnel-shaped opening at the top with baffles to keep out very large objects and help prevent the funnel from clogging. This designation is used when the specific type of sediment trap was not specified by the contributing investigator.,DeviceTerm,,tbd,,1/23/14
R2RE/9070,Sediment Trap - Floating,Floating sediment traps are specially designed sampling devices deployed to float in the water column (as opposed to being secured to a mooring at a fixed depth) for periods of time to collect particles from the water column that are falling toward the sea floor. In general a sediment trap has a container at the bottom to collect the sample and a broad funnel-shaped opening at the top with baffles to keep out very large objects and help prevent the funnel from clogging. The 'Sediment Trap -Floating' designation is used for a floating type of sediment trap about which no other design details are known.,DeviceTerm,,tbd,,1/23/14

R2RE/9073,Surface Velocity Program Drifter,"Modern satellite-tracked surface drifting buoy (drifter).  The modern drifter is a high-tech version of the message in a bottle. It consists of a surface buoy and a subsurface drogue (sea anchor), attached by a long, thin tether. The buoy measures temperature and other properties, and has a transmitter to send the data to passing satellites. The drogue dominates the total area of the instrument and is centered at a depth of 15 meters beneath the sea surface.   Lumpkin, R. and M.

R2RE/9076,underwater glider,"An underwater glider is a type of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that uses small changes in its buoyancy in conjunction with wings to convert vertical motion to horizontal, and thereby propel itself forward with very low power consumption. While not as fast as conventional AUVs, gliders using buoyancy-based propulsion represent a significant increase in range and duration compared to vehicles propelled by electric motor-driven propellers, extending ocean sampling missions from hours to weeks or months, and to thousands of kilometers of range. Gliders follow an up-and-down, sawtooth-like profile through the water, providing data on temporal and spatial scales unavailable to previous AUVs, and much more costly to sample using traditional shipboard techniques.",DeviceTerm,,tbd,,1/23/14
