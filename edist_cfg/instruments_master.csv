R2RE/9045,2D Acoustic current meter,"Falmouth Scientific, Inc. 2 Dimensional Acoustic Current Meter (2D-ACM) with optional CTD module offers an integrated platform in which to measure current, temperature, depth (tide), sound-velocity and salinity data. Using the phase-shift acoustic transit-time measurement technique, the 2D-ACM is an easy-to-use, high accuracy current meter, with no moving parts and a finite measurement volume. The phase-shift measurement principle allows the 2D-ACM to measure accurately, even in slow moving water and in water with no reflectors present (e.g. deep water). Internal compass and tilt sensors provide magnetic horizontal current vector direction, without the need for specific orientation of the current meter during deployment.  http://www.falmouth.com/support/technicalpapers.html","Falmouth Scientific, Inc. 2-Dimensional Acoustic Current Meter",ACM,current meter,deploy;recover;surveyedPosition;other,OK-ARM1 ,2/3/2014,,None

The Global Hybrid Profiler Mooring (GHPM) consists of a Surface Piercing Profiler (SPP or SeaCycler) to perform profiling measurements in the upper 150m of the water column and a Wire Following Profiler (WFP or McLane Moored Profiler) which takes profiling measurements 3 times per day between 300m to 2300m. Communication between the SPP and the lower part of the mooring (including the WFP) takes place inductively via the SIO controller in 2285m depth which collects all data and passes them to the SPP. The data from all these instruments get transmitted to shore through the satellite communication link of the Surface Piercing Profiler.

R2RE/9073,Surface Velocity Program Drifter,"Modern satellite-tracked surface drifting buoy (drifter).  The modern drifter is a high-tech version of the message in a bottle. It consists of a surface buoy and a subsurface drogue (sea anchor), attached by a long, thin tether. The buoy measures temperature and other properties, and has a transmitter to send the data to passing satellites. The drogue dominates the total area of the instrument and is centered at a depth of 15 meters beneath the sea surface.   Lumpkin, R. and M. Pazos, 2006: Measuring surface currents with Surface Velocity Program drifters: the instrument, its data, and some recent results.
