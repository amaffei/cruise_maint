R2RE/9045,2D Acoustic current meter,"Falmouth Scientific, Inc. 2 Dimensional Acoustic Current Meter (2D-ACM) with optional CTD module offers an integrated platform in which to measure current, temperature, depth (tide), sound-velocity and salinity data. Using the phase-shift acoustic transit-time measurement technique, the 2D-ACM is an easy-to-use, high accuracy current meter, with no moving parts and a finite measurement volume. The phase-shift measurement principle allows the 2D-ACM to measure accurately, even in slow moving water and in water with no reflectors present (e.g. deep water). Internal compass and tilt sensors provide magnetic horizontal current vector direction, without the need for specific orientation of the current meter during deployment.  http://www.falmouth.com/support/technicalpapers.html","2 Dimensional Acoustic Current Meter (2D-ACM) with optional CTD module offers an integrated platform in which to measure current, temperature, depth (tide), sound-velocity and salinity data.",ACM,current meter,deploy;recover;surveyedPosition;other,OK-ARM1,2/3/2014,,None,Acoustic Current Meter

Typical buoyancies of a few grams result in vertical velocities relative to the water of a few mm/s, small compared to the cm/s turbulent velocities in the mixed layer. The float&rsquo;s motion within the mixed layer thus closely imitates that of a planktonic organism.  The float can also profile vertically.  It sends data and receives commands using the Iridium satellite system.
