R2RE/9064,OOIAST2: OOI AST2 Hybrid Profiler Mooring SIO,OOIAST2,mooring,,Yes,The OOI At-Sea-Test 2 (AST2) Global Hybrid Profiler Mooring was deployed on Sept. 26. 2011 in approximately 2500 meters of water at a latitude of 39 degree North near the Pioneer Area which is south of Woods Hole. The Global Hybrid Profiler Mooring (GHPM) consists of a Surface Piercing Profiler (SPP or SeaCycler) to perform profiling measurements in the upper 150m of the water column and a Wire Following Profiler (WFP or McLane Moored Profiler) which takes profiling measurements 3 times per day between 300m to 2300m. Communication between the SPP and the lower part of the mooring (including the WFP) takes place inductively via the SIO controller in 2285m depth which collects all data and passes them to the SPP. The data from all these instruments get transmitted to shore through the satellite communication link of the Surface Piercing Profiler. The AST2 GHPM is a prototype of the Global GHPM moorings that will be deployed at the four Global OOI sites.  http://mooring.ucsd.edu/index.html?/projects/ooi/ooi_data.html,None,1/23/14

L22/NETT0147,Reeve Net,ReeveNet,plankton nets,,Yes,"A Reeve Net is a conventional ring net with a very large acrylic cylindrical cod-end (30 liters) designed to collect fragile gelatinous animals. The net is lowered to a particular depth and then hauled slowly back to the surface (5-10 m/min). Reeve (1981) also described a double net system with no bridle and flotation at the net mouth that is attached to a roller mechanism that rides on a tow wire. The roller system is locked in place by a pressure release device. Once below a set pressure, the roller and nets are released and they float slowly up the wire, gently collecting the zooplankton, without being influenced by the motion of the vessel and associated vertical wire movements.

L22/TOOL0266,Sea-Bird SBE 39 temperature recorder,SBE 39 TR,water temperature sensor,,Yes,"A high-accuracy temperature recorder (pressure optional) with internal battery and non-volatile memory for deployment at depths up to 10500 meters. It is intended for moorings or other long-term, fixed-site applications, as well as shorter-term deployments on nets, towed vehicles or ROVs. Calibration coefficients stored in EEPROM allow the SBE 39 to transmit data in engineering units. The SBE 39 thermistor has a long history of exceptional accuracy and stability (typical drift is less than 0.002C per year). The SBE 39 communicates directly with a computer via a standard RA-232 interface. For more information see http://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/documents/nodb/108627/",None,1/23/14

The magnetometer and associated electronics are held in a fibreglass towfish and the SeaSPY is available in three depth ratings: 1000 m, 3000 m and 6000 m.
