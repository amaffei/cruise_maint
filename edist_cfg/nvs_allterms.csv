This nozzle is the actual measuring point. A low flow of dry air (normally 7ml/min) is fed down an air tube to the top of the pressure point. When the air pressure in the air line equals the pressure exerted by the column of water above it, then the excess air is released as bubbles through the copper nozzle.

"L22/TOOL0016";"Ott pneumatic tide gauge";"Ott gauge";"The Ott pneumatic gauge derives its measuring signal from the pressure produced in a bubbler system. The pressure is applied to one end of a pivoted beam. On the other side of the pivot is a weight which is moved up and down the beam by an electric motor in order to counter balance the pressure signal. At the far end of the beam are electrical contacts which operate the motor in the correct sense when the beam moves out of balance.   The motor is also geared to a double helix shaft with the pen arm attached. The position of the pen is therefore proportional to the applied air pressure.";"2009-11-30"

"L22/TOOL0405";"National Marine Facilities Microelectrode Oxygen Sensor";"NMF Microelectrode DO";"A non-membrane dissolved oxygen sensor for marine applications. The sensor uses a platinum microelectrode and a counter electrode (thus far composed of copper). A measurement potential is applied to the microelectrode relative to a counter electrode, reducing the dissolved oxygen in the water and generating a current through the microelectrode proportional to the number of oxygen molecules at that electrode. The sensor was first used in 2000 and development is ongoing. Early versions of the instrument applied the measurement potential for up to 30 seconds, with sampling starting approximately one second after the potential was applied. The sensor response to oxygen remained almost constant for a given concentration and data could be sampled at frequencies exceeding 1 Hz. To reduce noise generated by sensitivity to flow fluctuations a mesoporous layer was used to increase the surface area of the microelectrode, but this proved unstable and was replaced by a stop-flow system which pumped water in to a very small chamber, with measurements being taken while the water was still. This significantly improved results but the sensor was still affected by small convection currents. The current version of the sensor only applies the measurement potential for a few 10s of milliseconds and data are collected at approximately 1 Hz in an attempt to minimise the effects of convection currents. The latest development is a very small sensor head containing an array of microelectrodes (currently an array of five) that work together. The counter electrode consists of silver or silver chloride.

Pure samples may also be injected directly into the MS. The instrument is not suited to dealing with mixtures of compounds, therefore it is usually coupled with a gas chromatograph (typically a ThermoQuest Trace 2000 GC) which separates the compounds first.
