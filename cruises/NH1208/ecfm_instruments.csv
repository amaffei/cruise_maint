"L221/NETT0097","MOCNESS modified Tucker trawl - Wiebe et al (1976, 1985)","","","MOCNESS","Has a 100 cm x 141 cm rigid mouth opening  with nine 0.333 mm nylon mesh nets 6 meters long. System powered electrically on conducting wire and originally controlled from surface deck unit and now computer controlled.  Sensors include pressure, temperature, conductivity, fluorometer, transmissometer, oxygen, and light. Versions include systems with 1/4, 1, 2, 4, 10 and 20 m2 mouth openings all using the same release mechanisms, sensors, and compute logging and controls [Wiebe and Benfield 2003 Plates 28 D; 29 A-D].","MOCNESS","start;end;abort;other","MODIFIED"

Sensors may be connected to a pump-fed plastic tubing circuit (usually temperature, salinity and oxygen) or stand-alone. All instruments (8 channels available) on the package are logged by the SBE 11. The unit is the production off the shelf version of the SBE 911 (each 911 was custom built to individual specification).","CTD911","start;end;abort;other","MODIFIED"
