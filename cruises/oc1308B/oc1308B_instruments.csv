"L22/TOOL0058","Sea-Bird SBE 911plus CTD","L05/130","CTD profilers","CTD911","High precision and accuracy CTD comprising an SBE 9plus underwater unit (SBE 3 temperature and SBE 4 conductivity sensors) and an SBE 11plus deck unit. Sensors may be connected to a pump-fed plastic tubing circuit (usually temperature, salinity and oxygen) or stand-alone. All instruments (8 channels available) on the package are logged by the SBE 11. The unit is the production off the shelf version of the SBE 911 (each 911 was custom built to individual specification).","CTD911","deploy;maxDepth;recover;abort;other","0"

It is constructed of plastic and titanium to ensure long life with minimum maintenance. It may optionally be interfaced to an external SBE 38 hull temperature sensor.","Thermosalinograph SBE45","startLine;endLine;abortLine;sampleLine","0"
"R2RE/1004","Generic ADCP150","L05/115","current profilers","ADCP150","An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, or Acoustic Doppler Profiler, is often referred to with the acronym ADCP. Scientists use the instrument to measure how fast water is moving across an entire water column. An ADCP anchored to the seafloor can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. The instrument can also be mounted horizontally on seawalls or bridge pilings in rivers and canals to measure the current profile from shore to shore, and to the bottoms of ships to take constant current measurements as the boats move. In very deep areas, they can be lowered on a cable from the surface.  The ADCP measures water currents with sound (150kHz), using a principle of sound waves called the Doppler effect.","ADCP150","start;stop;service;other","0"
