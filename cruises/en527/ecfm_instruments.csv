Sensors may be connected to a pump-fed plastic tubing circuit (usually temperature, salinity and oxygen) or stand-alone. All instruments (8 channels available) on the package are logged by the SBE 11. The unit is the production off the shelf version of the SBE 911 (each 911 was custom built to individual specification).","CTD911","deploy;maxDepth;recover;abort;other","0"
"R2RE/1003","Generic ADCP75","L05/115","current profilers","ADCP75","An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, or Acoustic Doppler Profiler, is often referred to with the acronym ADCP. Scientists use the instrument to measure how fast water is moving across an entire water column. An ADCP anchored to the seafloor can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. The instrument can also be mounted horizontally on seawalls or bridge pilings in rivers and canals to measure the current profile from shore to shore, and to the bottoms of ships to take constant current measurements as the boats move. In very deep areas, they can be lowered on a cable from the surface.  The ADCP measures water currents with sound (75kHz), using a principle of sound waves called the Doppler effect.","ADCP75","start;stop;service;other","0"

It is constructed of plastic and titanium to ensure long life with minimum maintenance. It may optionally be interfaced to an external SBE 38 hull temperature sensor.","Thermosalinograph SBE45","startLine;endLine;abortLine;sampleLine","0"
"R2RE/1005","Generic ADCP300","L05/115","current profilers","ADCP300","A Doppler velocity log (DVL) measuring bottom track and water track velocities, altitude, heading, tilt, temperature, echo intensity, pressure and current velocities. 300kHz Broadband signal processing gives high data resolution and a four-beam solution gives an independent error velocity measurement as an indicator of data quality. It has a bottom track range of 200m and velocity accuracy for both bottom and water track modes is 0.4% of the velocity, 0.2cm/s. The instrument operates effectively over a temperature range of -5C to 45C and with a tilt of up to 15 deg.","ADCP300","start;stop;service;other","0"

As MOCNESS tows behind a research ship, each net can be opened and shut independently so that it samples a discrete patch of water. The researcher chooses exactly when by using the environmental sensing system. This is an array of sensors mounted on the instrument frame that relays water conditions up to the ship in real time. The data also help researchers match what they find in their sample to the physical properties of the seawater.","MOCNESS1","deploy;maxDepth;recover;abort;other","0"

"R2RE/9070","Sediment Trap - Floating","L051/33","sediment traps","FloatingSedTrap","Floating sediment traps are specially designed sampling devices deployed to float in the water column (as opposed to being secured to a mooring at a fixed depth) for periods of time to collect particles from the water column that are falling toward the sea floor. In general a sediment trap has a container at the bottom to collect the sample and a broad funnel-shaped opening at the top with baffles to keep out very large objects and help prevent the funnel from clogging. The 'Sediment Trap -Floating' designation is used for a floating type of sediment trap about which no other design details are known.","FloatingSedTrap","start;stop;other;","0"

Multiple coring tubes with varying sampling capacity depending on tube dimensions are mounted in a frame designed to sample the deep ocean seafloor. For more information, see Barnett et al.

Data is simultaneously stored in memory and transmitted to a computer serial port, allowing independent data logging and real-time data acquisition. Typically mounted near the ship's seawater intake, the SBE 21 is connected to an AC-powered interface box positioned near the computer. The interface box provides power and an isolated data interface, and contains a NMEA 0183 port for appending navigation information to the data stream.","Thermosalinograph SBE21","start;stop;other;","0"
