Sensors may be connected to a pump-fed plastic tubing circuit (usually temperature, salinity and oxygen) or stand-alone. All instruments (8 channels available) on the package are logged by the SBE 11. The unit is the production off the shelf version of the SBE 911 (each 911 was custom built to individual specification).","CTD911","deploy;maxDepth;recover;abort;other","0"

Data is simultaneously stored in memory and transmitted to a computer serial port, allowing independent data logging and real-time data acquisition. Typically mounted near the ship's seawater intake, the SBE 21 is connected to an AC-powered interface box positioned near the computer. The interface box provides power and an isolated data interface, and contains a NMEA 0183 port for appending navigation information to the data stream.","Thermosalinograph SBE21","start;stop;other;","0"
