Sensors may be connected to a pump-fed plastic tubing circuit (usually temperature, salinity and oxygen) or stand-alone. All instruments (8 channels available) on the package are logged by the SBE 11. The unit is the production off the shelf version of the SBE 911 (each 911 was custom built to individual specification).","CTD911","deploy;maxDepth;recover;abort;other","0"

It has a bottom track range of 200m and velocity accuracy for both bottom and water track modes is 0.4% of the velocity, ±0.2cm/s. The instrument operates effectively over a temperature range of -5°C to 45°C and with a tilt of up to ±15 deg.","ADCP300","star;stop;service;other","0"
