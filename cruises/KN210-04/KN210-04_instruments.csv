Sensors may be connected to a pump-fed plastic tubing circuit (usually temperature, salinity and oxygen) or stand-alone. All instruments (8 channels available) on the package are logged by the SBE 11. The unit is the production off the shelf version of the SBE 911 (each 911 was custom built to individual specification).","CTD911","deploy;maxDepth;recover;abort;other","0"

"R2RE/1003","Generic ADCP75","L05/115","current profilers","ADCP75","An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, or Acoustic Doppler Profiler, is often referred to with the acronym ADCP. Scientists use the instrument to measure how fast water is moving across an entire water column. An ADCP anchored to the seafloor can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. The instrument can also be mounted horizontally on seawalls or bridge pilings in rivers and canals to measure the current profile from shore to shore, and to the bottoms of ships to take constant current measurements as the boats move. In very deep areas, they can be lowered on a cable from the surface.  The ADCP measures water currents with sound (75kHz), using a principle of sound waves called the Doppler effect.","ADCP75","start;stop;service;other","0"

It has a bottom track range of 200m and velocity accuracy for both bottom and water track modes is 0.4% of the velocity, ±0.2cm/s. The instrument operates effectively over a temperature range of -5°C to 45°C and with a tilt of up to ±15 deg.","ADCP300","start;stop;service;other","0"

"R2RE/1020","Generic mooring","R2RE/1019","mooring","Mooring","A collection of devices, connected to a wire and temporarily anchored on the sea floor.  A mooring can be free floating or anchored for some days to weeks (short-time). Long-time moorings might be deployed for a maximum duration of two years. An acoustic release connects the mooring to an anchor weight on the sea floor. The weight is released by sending a coded acoustic command signal from a ship. The weight (e.g. old rail wheels) is unrecoverable. Floaters permit the mooring to come up to the surface to be recovered by a research vessel.","Mooring","recover;other","MODIFIED"
