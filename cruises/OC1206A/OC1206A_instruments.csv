Sensors may be connected to a pump-fed plastic tubing circuit (usually temperature, salinity and oxygen) or stand-alone. All instruments (8 channels available) on the package are logged by the SBE 11. The unit is the production off the shelf version of the SBE 911 (each 911 was custom built to individual specification).","CTD911","deploy;maxDepth;recover;abort;other","0"
